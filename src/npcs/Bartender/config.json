    "backdoor": "Last week, somebody tried breaking into the bar through the backdoor. They wedged the door open with a crowbar but they didn't realize the backdoor routes through the basement and they must have gotten spooked by something because nothing was missing. All of the alcohol in the bar is upstairs, there's nothing to steal down there but junk.",
    "basement": "The basement is a mess. There's a lot of junk down there. There's a door that leads to the back alley. Vega hasn't noticed anything suspicious except the broken down backdoor last week.",

    "smuggler": "Vega's father was a smuggler of alcohol and he grew up around the business, which has led him to have some questionable connections.",

    "border": "Vega may or may not know how to get things across the border but he doesn't trust you yet so he won't tell you what you'd like to know about it",
